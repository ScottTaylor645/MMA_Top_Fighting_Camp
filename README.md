This project was inspired by my love of MMA fighting, I am a retired fighter myself specializing in Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu as my art forms of choice.

It proved to be a little bit more tedious to come to my conclusion than I initially thought it would. Challenging yet impowering to work on this project. 

My goal was to see who is the training center who produces the top fighters. 

Above some of the cells you will discover some markdown explaining what is going on with my code. 

This journey has showed me alot about the training camps and who is producing great fighters. I also learned from visiting the  wins, loses, and tkos pie chart it shows that tkos displays a dominant position in the three catagories.

In conclusion AKA(America Kickboxing Academy) is the dominant training Center with over 400 wins as a training camp, looks like if I come out of retirement I know which camp I will be training with.
